### Self Critique

---

### What did we do well?

+++
- @fa[paw]() We did not know how to use things like React and Flask but we learned quickly

+++

- @fa[paw]() We were willing to dig through documentation and understand how all the libraries we were using worked

+++

- @fa[paw]() We were not afraid to communicate about stories that we were falling behind on

+++

- @fa[paw]() We shared code equally and made changes to each otherâ€™s work to improve quality

---
### What did we learn?

+++

- @fa[paw]() How to create a visualization with D3.js
+++

- @fa[paw]() Set up a postgres database
+++

- @fa[paw]() How to deal with merge conflicts and conflicts in general

---
### What can we do better?
+++

- @fa[paw]() If a library exists, learn it and use it.

+++

- @fa[paw]() Write tests first instead of the end, especially if you don't know how the testing libraries work

---
### What puzzles us?

### What did they do well?

+++

- @fa[paw]() Good for health conscious users

+++

- @fa[paw]() Nice overall aesthetics

---

### What did we learn from their website?
+++

- @fa[paw]() Error handling

+++

- @fa[paw]() Their usage of Travis showed us how to use continuous integration on a large project

+++

- @fa[paw]() We learned that met stands for metabolic equivalent, a measure of energy cost of physical activities 

---

### What can they do better?

+++

- @fa[paw]() They can expose the relationship between models via the API
- @fa[paw]() Difficult to make insights using API

Note:
Simply returns data about that specific instance
Customers cannot get information that is exposed on the website via the API

+++

- @fa[paw]() They can separate pagination of the models on the search page
- @fa[paw]() Disrupts flow of navigation

Note:
Page position is lost while naviating

---

### What puzzles us about their website?

+++

- @fa[paw]() Many of the model suggestions seem random
- @fa[paw]() Results unexpectedly change upon refreshing the page

Note:
Suggestions are less meaningful

+++

- @fa[paw]() It doesn't seem like they are utilizing their own API

Note:
Functionality is often missing from the API because they aren't using it
Changes require reloading the page, as data is sent with HTML
